The key rules that applies across individual frame scores
  Basic >> a + b
  Half strike >> a = 10 + b = the first roll from the next frame
  Strike >> a = 10 + b = the next 2 rolls from the next frames (e.g. could carry over frames if 2 strikes in a row)

MVP
  - have a scorecard object/ function class
  - have a method that takes in rolls and adds to an array (Rolls >> [[1,2], [10,0], [3,4], [5,5]])
  - have a method that stops each array element from being over 10
  - have a method that calculates the total score for basic [0,1] combination
    >> some sort of reduce method

Scorecard specs
  >> I want to have a scorecard
  >> I want to be able to store all my individual roll scores by frame
  >> I want to be able to score a basic game (no strikes or half strikes)
  >> I want to be able to score an advanced game with half strikes
  >> I want to be able to score a more advanced game with strikes
  >> I want to be able to score a full game with a 10th frame
  >> I want to be able to see my total cumulative score in a UI
  >> I want to be able to see my individual frame scores in a UI
  >> I want to be able to see my cumulative frame scores in a UI

Scorecard.prototype.frameScore = function(a, b) {
  a + b
}
